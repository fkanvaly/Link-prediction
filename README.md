# Link-prediction
---------------------------------------------
For this semester we study a lot of machine learning technics and the challenge was a good opportunity to practice. Here the subject was link prediction, which aim is to predict new connections based on existing ones in the network. They give a training graph with 425737 edges and 33750 nodes. Our approaches were to explore features extraction methods using handcraft features or deep learning.
